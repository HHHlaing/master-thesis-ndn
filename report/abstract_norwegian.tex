Oversett:

The IP network was built decades ago, and with todays use of Internet, a new network layer protocol has shown to be needed.
Named Data Networking (NDN) is a proposal for content-centric discovery and routing approach to networking. 
Yet, the public key infrastructure issue has not been solved in NDN. 
Identity-based cryptography (IBC) seems to be applicable to wireless sensor networks, and even more applicable when deployed over NDN.

In this paper I explain the NDN architecture and the basics of IBC. 
I model and implement a trust model in a thought sensor network using IBC, running over NDN.

Implementing and testing my proposal verifies the usability of developing applications over NDN, 
and the relevancy of IBC over wireless sensor network running over NDN.

I formally prove the security in the protocols suggested for device registration and data pull under deployment in a sensor network, using IBC and running over NDN.
