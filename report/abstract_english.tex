\begin{abstract}
The IP network was built decades ago, and with today's use of Internet, a new network layer protocol is much needed.
Named Data Networking (NDN) is a proposal for content-centric discovery and routing. 
Yet, the public key infrastructure issue has not been solved in NDN. 
Identity-based cryptography (IBC) seems to be applicable to wireless sensor networks, and even more applicable when deployed over NDN.

In this paper I will explain the NDN architecture and the basics of IBC. 
Further, I will model and implement a trust model in a thought sensor network using IBC, running over NDN.

Implementing and testing my proposal verifies the relevancy of IBC over wireless sensor network running over NDN, and the usability of developing applications over NDN.

I formally and informally prove the security in the protocols suggested for device registration and data pull under deployment in the application.
