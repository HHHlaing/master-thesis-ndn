The IP network was built decades ago, and with todays use of Internet, a new network layer protocol has shown to be needed.
Named Data Networking (NDN) is a proposal for content-centric discovery and routing approach to networking. 
Yet, the trust model in NDN has not been solved. 
Identity-based cryptography (IBC) seems to be applicable to wireless sensor networks, and even more applicable when deployed over NDN.

In this paper I explain the NDN architecture and the basics of IBC. 
I model and implement a trust model in a thought sensor network using IBC, running over NDN.

Implementing and testing my proposal verifies the usability of developing to NDN, and the relevancy of IBC over wireless sensor network running over NDN.

Conclusion..
