\chapter{Conclusion and Future Work}\label{chp7:conclusion}
In this chapter the conclusion of thesis will be presented and the dangling future work will be listed.

\section{Conslusion}
In this thesis I have developed a Health Sensor System in Python with Identity-Based Cryptography used for signing and verification, encryption and decryption.
The system is build over the new network protocol Named Data Networking.

I have suggested how a secure system can be implemented.

The system is tested to see how the suggested protocols for initialization and data pull performs with \gls{IBC}. 
This work is a attempt to show how applicable \gls{NDN} is for \gls{IoT} and to design secure protocols for local device networks.

\section{Future Work}
Integrate the \gls{FSM} in to the \gls{HSS}.

Test solution on relevant sensors and devices.

Implement a full worthy \gls{IBC} solution in \gls{PyNDN2}.

Make a scheme that uses the same \gls{MPK} and \gls{MSK} to do encryption/decryption and signing/verification.
