\section{Public Key Distribution}
Instead of the PKI, where each pk is signed by a certificate authority and the generated certificate is sent as a response in https, then validated by the the client, we want to make the certificate authority obsolete by distributing every PK and rather trust the name (e.g. /ntnu/). 

\subsection{Key Revocation}
Key Revocation becomes obsolete with Public Key Sync.
