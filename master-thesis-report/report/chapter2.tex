This chapter will give a brief overlook of the motivation for \gls{ICN},
as well as explaining more details of how \gls{ICN} protocols, such as \gls{CCN} and \gls{NDN}, works. 
It will also contain a quick summary of related works.

\section{Motivation for \gls{ICN}}
When Internet was created in the 1960's, the researchers where inspired by the existing communication network, the telecommunication network.
Because it was not natural and logical to think that people would download content, but rather send and receive short messages and instructions, the node to node communication model was a logical architecture. 
As internet have developed, we now know that close to 80\% \todo{find cite} of all \gls{IP} traffic is content download, and not communication. 
With this in mind, the \gls{IP} architecture does not provide an effictient transport model for what we are actually using the network for.

The \gls{IP} network was not designed with security in mind. 
Most of the protocols related to Internet have been designed and deployed mainly with the goal of functionality to work.
\gls{IPsec} is a very good example. 

A node in a \gls{IP} network does not know WHAT goes through, but rather the packet's endpoints, i.e. WHERE it goes and WHERE it comes from. 
This makes every node dumb, hence the network is designed for redundancy.

IP/TCP not designed for broadcast. 
Wireless connection is not easy.
\todo{Find sources for content based traffic}

These concepts are the reason why we need \gls{ICN}. 
\gls{IRTF} established \gls{ICN} working group 2012

\section{\gls{ICN} Protocols}\label{chp2:sec:icn}
\gls{CCN} was publicly presented by Van Jacobsen in 2006.
The research project is lead by \gls{PARC}.
Jacobsen has contributed to TCP/IP, i.a. with his flow control algorithms and TCP header compression. 

A branch of \gls{CCN} is the \gls{NDN}~\cite{DBLP:journals/ccr/0001ABJcCPWZ14} research project started in 2010.
One of the biggest contributers is \gls{UCLA}, with Lixia Zhang in the lead.

\section{NDN Architecture}\label{chp2:sec:ndn_architecture}

Describe the architecture ~\cite{NDN-0021}

Pull-based which means that there is no content in the network, that is not requested from someone.
Reduces unwanted traffic/content. 
Two types of packets in \gls{NDN}. Interest packet and the corresponding answer, i.e. data packet, illustrated in~\autoref{fig:packets}.
The interest packet specifies a content name. The name has a hierarchical structure, e.g. \"/ntnu/item/haakon\".  
An interest can also contain a selector that can be used to decide which data to satisfy the interest in case of multiple matches.

Security aspects of the network protocol. 
The network demands that every packet delivered from application layer is signed by the application for integrity and authenticity.

Nodes know WHAT (name) they have. 
Nodes know what content they have, hence can share relevant data.

Face - an interface. Can be Ethernet, TCP/UDP, Websocket
strip away link layer headers (if any)

\subsubsection{\gls{PIT}}\label{pit}
\gls{PIT}~\autoref{fig:icn-model-node}- All pending or recently satisfied Interests are stored here, together with the incoming and outgoing interface.
If a new incoming Interest matches a entry in the \gls{PIT}, the incoming interface will be added to the entry. 


\subsubsection{\gls{CS}}\label{content-store}
\gls{CS}~\autoref{fig:icn-model-node} - When a node receives a Data packet that has a corresponding entry in the \gls{PIT}, it stores the data packet in the \gls{CS}. \gls{CS} is a cache of data packets.


\subsubsection{\gls{FIB}}\label{fib}
\gls{FIB}~\autoref{fig:icn-model-node} - Here a forwarding strategy is stored for each prefix. 
When a node forwards a Interest, it will do a longest prefix lookup in the \gls{FIB} and send the interest further to the best matching interface.


\subsubsection{\gls{RIB}}\label{rib}
\gls{RIB}~\autoref{fig:icn-model-node} - \todo{where?}

 
\subsection{Incoming Interest}
Incoming Interest through a interface (Face). The node checks the \gls{PIT} for pending or recently satisfied interests. 
If there is no match, the node will do a lookup in \gls{CS} to see if a corresponding Data packet is cached. 
If there is a match in the \gls{PIT} it will anly add the interface to the \gls{PIT} entry. If there is a match in the \gls{CS} the node will return the Data. 
If there is no match in either the \gls{PIT} or the \gls{CS} the node will make a new \gls{PIT} entry and do a longest prefix match lookup in the \gls{FIB} to decide which interface to forward the Interest.
\todo{decision tree}

\subsection{Incoming Data}
The node will check  the \gls{PIT} for an entry, if match it will forward the data to all the interfaces registered in the \gls{PIT} entry.
Check data from local applications first cached in \gls{CS}, if not, store in \gls{CS} send data to all requesters (\gls{PIT})
\todo{decision tree}

\subsection{Outgoing Interest}
How to forward a Interest; routing strategy. A strategy per \gls{PIT} entry. I.e. whether, when, and where to forward Interest.
\todo{decision tree}

\subsection{Outgoing Data}
Send data through all interfaces registered in the \gls{PIT} entry. I.e. all requesters.
\todo{decision tree}

\subsection{Naming}\label{naming}
Naming is left to the application design.

\gls{DNS} naming
Email naming
\gls{OS} naming

\subsection{Anonymity}
Based on the nature of the architecture, \gls{NDN} facilitates the practice of anonymity in the network. 
Same concept as Tor network\todo{cite} and anonymity.
If a packet is captured at any arbitrary point of its path, the only information an adversary will get, is the two nodes between the packet capture and the data name. Unless monitoring a complete network, it should be close to impossible to track packets.  

Secure data VS secure channel

\section{Multicast By Nature}\label{ndn-multicast}

In~\autoref{fig:ndn-multicast} we can se that the network does not nearly have to send equal amount of traffic if every node is a \gls{NDN} node.
