\chapter{Background}\label{chp:background} 
Ingress. 
Motivation for ICN and NDN
This chapter presents...

\section{IP/TCP}
IP/TCP not designed for broadcast
Not designed for content, but rather point-to-point. 
Why? Telecommunication architecture. 
Natural and logical to design after these principles.
Security? Not designed with security in mind. IPSec
Nodes know nothing

\section{Information-Centric networking}\label{chp2:sec:icn}
\gls{ICN} ...


Named data networking~\cite{DBLP:journals/ccr/0001ABJcCPWZ14}

\section{NDN Architecture}\label{chp2:sec:ndn_architecture}
\gls{NDN} ...

Describe the architecture ~\cite{NDN-0021}

Interest packet
Data packet

Pull-based which means that there is no content in the network, that is not requested from someone.
Reduces unwanted traffic/content. 

Security aspects of the network protocol. 
Demands security from application layer.
Nodes know WHAT (name) they have. 

\subsection{Naming}
Naming is left to the application design.

\subsection{Anonymity}
Describe the concept, based on the nature of the architecture.
