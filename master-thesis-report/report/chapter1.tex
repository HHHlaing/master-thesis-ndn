\chapter{Introduction}\label{chp:introduction} 

\section{Motivation}
The translation from name to address and location is a fundamental problem to all networks.
\gls{NDN} is a proposal for content-centric discovery and routing approach to networking
going on at the \gls{UCLA}, which is part of the inspiration and a contact point for this work.

In general, the name to address resolution can either be maintained by a catalogue lookup service, 
such as \gls{DNS} (Internet) and \gls{HLR} (mobile networks), 
or resolved on-the-fly by a protocol on request, such as \gls{ARP} (\gls{LAN}). 
There has been a tremendous amount of work done on the naming problem in distributed systems, 
some became big failures (e.g. X.500) others such as the web \gls{URL}s are very successful. 
Bringing things even further, the \gls{DOI} system is a \gls{URI} directed at the content/object itself rather than a location. 
Very much related to the name/address problem is the information security problem of efficient and practical public key distribution, 
which remain unsolved in practice, even though a significant number of digital certificate and verification protocols and schemes have been proposed, and systems tested over the last two decades. 
One notable and early theoretical proposal is Rivest and Lampson \gls{SDSI} proposal~\cite{rivest1996sdsi},
and subsequent work, that may be revisited for applicable to named data networking.

\section{Problem and Scope}

When designing a new network protocol for the future Internet, one of the most significant changes should be that it is designed for security.
Trust management plays a big part in security, and thus we cannot design trust management on known \gls{IP} failures such as X.500. 
\gls{PKI} is a tough challenge to solve and the solution is probably not the one or the other, but rather case specific.

I address the trust management issue in a though sensor device network, e.g. a health sensor network.
By using the \gls{NFD} I will implement my proposal for such a sensor network over \gls{NDN}.

\section{Methodology}

First I find in what context the Public Key System can be applicable, then I design the application flow in sequence diagrams.
Based on how \gls{NDN} is designed, I try to implement the proposed design and see where to redesign the application proposal for achieving minimal communication overhead, security (i.e. \gls{CIA}) and usability.

\section{Outline}

This paper will first introduce one of the proposed protocols for the future Internet, \gls{NDN}.
I will explain the architecture of \gls{NDN} as well as some related work regarding my application proposal. 
The application modules will be explain in detail and implementation choices will be discussed.
At last I will present the results of the implementation and my conclusion of the trust model the application uses.
