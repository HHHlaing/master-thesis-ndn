\chapter{Discussion}
In this chapter it will be discussed 

\section{Identity-Based Cryptography]}
One suggestion has been to add a monthly timestamp~\cite{DBLP:journals/iacr/BoldyrevaGK12} ~\cite{DBLP:conf/ctrsa/LibertV09} \todo{find better cite} to the name, but the the \gls{PKG} has to renew private keys for everybody each month. 
This solution scales very badly.
With the \gls{PKG}s Name Sync application, every user will be notified when a identity is revoked.
There is no use for periodically checking names.

\subsection{Trusting Trusted Third Party in Identity-Based Cryptography}
Issues of trusting the \gls{PKG}, i.e. a \gls{TTP}. 
If the \gls{PKG} is compromised by an adversary, the adversary will retrieve all private keys corresponding to all IDs that used the compromised \gls{PKG}. 
Do every ID trust the \gls{PKG}? Suspicion of \gls{MITM}, where the \gls{PKG} is the adversary, will always be a problem for a user.
Secure channel for private key exchange. 

\section{Health Sensor System}
Not tested on with real sensors, hence I cannot conclude with anything regarding the computational power of such devices, nor the life time of the battery when performing \gls{IBE}.  

\subsection{Sync}
The sync application makes it possible for users to know who has a valid public key within the \gls{PKG}s domain.
One drawback with the IDSync solution is that for the sender to be 100\% sure that the message is encrypted with the latest \gls{ID}, the sender has to rely on that it has reveiced the latest sync state available from the \gls{PKG}.
Likewise when a receiver verifies a signature, it has to rely on the same principle to be able to know if the belonging \gls{ID} is still valid.

\subsection{Attacks}
In~\cite{DBLP:conf/spw/StajanoA99} Frank Stajano and Ross Anderson mentions possible \gls{DoS} attacks, suck as radio jamming and battery exhaustion. 
All applications that are relying on some sort of crucial information derived from a Sync application~\autoref{file-sync} are vulnerable to \gls{DoS}.

\section{Other Use Cases}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Home Automation Systems
	\item 
\end{enumerate}

\section{Scalability}
IDSync can be an issue, as the list that is being distributed is growing linearly with the number of participants in the trust domain.
