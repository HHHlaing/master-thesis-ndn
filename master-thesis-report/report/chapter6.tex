In this chapter it will be discussed 

\section{Identity-Based Encryption}
One suggestion has been to add a monthly timestamp~\cite{DBLP:journals/iacr/BoldyrevaGK12} ~\cite{DBLP:conf/ctrsa/LibertV09} \todo{find better cite} to the name, but the the \gls{PKG} has to renew private keys for everybody each month. 
This solution scales very badly.
With the \gls{PKG}s Name Sync application, every user will be notified when a identity is revoked.
There is no use for periodically checking names.

\section{Trusting Trusted Third Party in Identity-Based Cryptography}
Issues of trusting the \gls{PKG}, i.e. a \gls{TTP}. 
If the \gls{PKG} is compromised by an adversary, the adversary will retrieve all private keys corresponding to all IDs that used the compromised \gls{PKG}. 
Do every ID trust the \gls{PKG}? Suspicion of \gls{MITM}, where the \gls{PKG} is the adversary, will always be a problem for a user.
Secure channel for private key exchange.
