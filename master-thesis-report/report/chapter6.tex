\section{Trusting Trusted Third Party in Identity Based Cryptography}
Issues of trusting the \gls{PKG}, i.e. a \gls{TTP}. 
If the \gls{PKG} is compromised by an adversary, the adversary will retrieve all private keys corresponding to all IDs that used the compromised \gls{PKG}. 
Do every ID trust the \gls{PKG}? Suspicion of \gls{MITM}, where the \gls{PKG} is the adversary, will always be a problem for a user.
Secure channel for private key exchange.
