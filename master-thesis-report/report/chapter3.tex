ChronoSync
Encode data into crypto digest, i.e. a state digest, to exchange states between all parties. 
If the state is equal to the one stored locally, then nothing should happen.
If not, two options are available; 
- the differences of the dataset state can be directly inferred
and sent as the response to the sync interest if the state
digest is the same as one of the previous local state
digests;
- a state reconciliation method is used to determine the dif-
ferences of the knowledge if the state digest is unknown
(for example, when recovering from a network partition).
